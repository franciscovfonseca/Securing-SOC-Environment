<br>

<br>

In the previous labs we performed some **Incident Response**, and we even **Remediated some Vulnerabilities** like Hardening the NSGs.

We also **Captured our Environment's Traffic** in an Insecured State for 24 hours & **Recorded our Security Metrics**.

<br>

In this next step of our Project we‚Äôll work towards **Securing our Environment**.

<br>

Basically in this lab we‚Äôre going to:

  -	Look at Microsoft Defender for Cloud‚Äôs **Secure Score**.
    
  -	Look at Microsoft Defender for Cloud‚Äôs **Recommendations**, and learn what that is.
    
  -	Enable MDC‚Äôs **Regulatory Compliance for NIST 800-53**.

<summary> <h2>1Ô∏è‚É£ Inspect MDC Secure Score & Recommendations</h2> </summary>
<br>

The first thing we‚Äôre going to do is Inspect the [**Microsoft Defender for Cloud Secure Score**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/microsoft-secure-score?view=o365-worldwide)

We‚Äôll go to the **Azure Portal** ‚ûú open **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08ab92a6-b905-431a-a3ad-37cc7f009423)

<br>

> Defender for Cloud provides us with a üõ°Ô∏è **Secure Score**.
> 
> It‚Äôs a single metric that we can use to gage our **Security Posture** and how good it is.
>   
>   </details>

<br>

Then we can click on the **Recommendations** blade on the left side:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa067180-eb69-49ce-a58a-c2755c4dec22)

<br>

The interface will show us all the things that are contributing to our Environment‚Äôs **Security Score**.

<br>

  <details close> 
  
**<summary> üí° </summary>**

It‚Äôll show us areas that essentially have gaps:

‚û°Ô∏è So we can implement things in Azure & perform some Configurations in order to make our Security Score go Up.

<br>

  </details>

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40fd5b5b-75d8-4f88-93dc-3fb5acf65eb4)

<br>

üîç We can look through all the different **Recommendations** and get a good sense of what we can do to **Harden our Environment**.

<br>

<h2></h2>
<br>

<h3>Inspect MDC Recommendations</h3>

<br>

If we click on ```View recommendations >```:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb6bf830-e0b1-445f-9a64-77f6983bc2c0)

<br>

It'll show all the things that are contributing to our **Secure Score** ‚ûú areas in our Environment that essentially have "Gaps".

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1ade39b-9c81-487b-82ce-e8ce851bfe5d)

<br>

We can implent things in **Azure** ‚ûú make some Configurations to get our **Secure Score** to go Up.

For example: under ```> Restrict unauthorized network access``` ‚ûú if we click on the first Recommendation:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04a75668-ffb7-492f-be99-88b53cca10c6)

<br>

MDC will give us Recommendations on how we can fix it:

- There's a detailed **Description** of what the Recomendation involves.
  
- And there's also the **Remediation Steps** section that breaks down what we have do to Remediate the issue.

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed0fc54d-4774-422b-9fff-d4f379a02a76)

<br>

‚úÖ So we've analysed the **Recommendations** that when fixed would improve our Environmen's **Secure Score**.

<br>

The next thing we‚Äôre going to do is **Enable Regulatory Compliance for NIST 800-53**.

This will basically do the same thing as the **MDC Secure Score Recommendations** ‚ûú but it‚Äôll do it in the ‚Äúlens‚Äù of **NIST 800-53**.

<br>

**<summary> üìå Refresher</summary>**

<br>

[NIST 800-53](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_0/home) is a really large control catalog with a lot of different control families like:

-	 Access Control
-	 Identification and Authentication
-	 Incidence Response, etc.

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c252a0a1-7952-41a2-8ef2-539f45ddcefa)

<br>

These are all different categories ‚ûú and then inside of these there‚Äôs a lot of **Sub-Controls** essentially

For example: inside of **"SC - SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATION PROTECTION"** ‚ûú there's a lot of different Categories:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5126055b-5f4b-4456-9aba-62efb764c7e1)

<br>

When we enable NIST 800-53 Regulatory Compliance inside of Defender for Cloud:

  - It‚Äôs basically going to look at all the different Controls inside of NIST 800-53
    
  - And it'll suggest different things we can do in our Environment that align with, for example, SC-7:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d95d567-d4ed-4ef9-9c4b-6a65a3cf5c89)

<br>

Essentially it will suggest different implementations we can do in Azure to bring our Environment "Up to Par" with NIST 800-53.

In a way, show us Gaps in relation to Controls that exist in NIST 800-53.

  </details>

<br>

To add NIST 800-53:

  - First inside the MDC home page ‚ûú click on the **Regulatory Compliance** blade on the left side:
![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5072ca93-f076-4163-80c2-967704432b2f)

<br>

  - Then at the top ‚ûú click on **Manage compliance policies**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67f38c0f-4c42-4080-8e07-d4a3db87e06d)

<br>

  - We'll then click on our ```Azure subscription 1```:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44cef131-d6fe-4065-918b-d009306265d7)

<br>

  - Inside the **Security policy** blade ‚ûú under **Industry & regulatory standards**  ‚ûú click on the **"Add more standards"** button:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80d7228c-709e-46e2-981b-37028c7a5374)

<br>

  - Add ```NIST 800-53 R5``` as a **Regulatory Compliance Standard**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f66d02b4-3cb0-40f1-aa86-91f56bdc8263)

<br>

- We'll leave the Initiative Assignment Configurations as the default ones ‚ûú so just click **"Create"**

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29baa074-9bbf-444f-a9b4-8a25ebf31d8e)

<br>

The Policy Initiative Assignment takes a few minutes to take effect.

After waiting a while ‚ûú we can confirm that **NIST 800-53 R5** was successfully assigned to our Subscription ‚úÖ

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28fedd9f-d9c4-4c85-96ae-75f482a76827)

<br>


‚ö†Ô∏è Again ‚ûú it takes some time for the policy to be added to our Environment.

But eventually it should appear inside of our MDC Dashboard ‚ûú under **Regulatory compliance**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d75d993f-2264-4122-98a5-1b36ebc9f5b9)

<br>


  <details close> 
  
**<summary> üìù Recap</summary>**

Basically **NIST 800-53** contains a whole bunch of **Control Families** with different Controls that we can apply to our Environment.

NIST 800-53 is not specific to any Environment ‚ûú they're just generalized Controls.

But Microsoft created this NIST 800-53 Policy to map those General Controls to things that we can actually do inside of **Azure**.

This are the general **Control Families** defined by **NIST**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66c76459-949a-4f33-880b-c9d878f13baf)

<br>

If we expand one of the Control Families ‚ûú **‚ÄúAC. Access Control‚Äù** for example:

It shows what we can do inside of the Azure Portal to our Resources to be **‚ÄúCompliant‚Äù** with each individual Sub-Control:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09b96474-e6de-4a32-b7a9-6323467736db)

<br>

Again as an example: for **IR-6(2)** as defined by NIST ‚ûú there could be some Improvements made in our Environment:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eeebf9e4-d92f-4f3d-8855-9dcc1c853c7d)

<br>

We can click on the first **Automated assessment** ‚ûú and MDC will give us Instructions on how to remediate this issue:

If we expand the ```‚à® Remediation steps``` ‚ûú it'll give us the Steps to Take in order to Manually Remidiate this Sub-Control.

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/573f186d-db6b-45c2-bc91-e425a4433845)

<br>

  </details>

<br>

‚û°Ô∏è In our upcoming lab ‚ûú we're going to implement **SC-7 Boundary Protection**, in order to bring this Control "Up to Compliance".

<h1>Summary</h1>
<br>

In this lab we Enabled NIST 800-53 Regulatory Compliance Policy.

Basically when we did that ‚ûú Azure looked at our entire Environment and compared it to NIST 800-53 General Control Families:

<br>

<p align="center">
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52efb6c2-59e0-4025-a9c9-ef8f298032d8" alt="Banner"/>

<br>

<br>

In doing so, it essentially found all the weak spots in our Environment that could be addressed by the **NIST 800-53 Control Catalog**.

And in the next lab we'll start remediating a few of these **Compliance Controls**.
